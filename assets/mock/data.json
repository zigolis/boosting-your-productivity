    "synopsis": "Bond is back and on the loose in exotic Istanbul looking for a super-secret coding machine. He's involved with a beautiful Russian spy and has the SPECTRE organization after him, including villainess Rosa Klebb (she of the killer shoe). Lots of exciting escapes but not an overreliance on the gadgetry of the later films. The second Bond feature, thought by many to be the best."
